# About Sinag

Sinag is a minimal starting point for custom WordPress theme development. It starts off with a white page with blue links that turn purple when you click themâ€”in other words, practically nothingâ€”allowing you to add your own code rather than wrestling with a bunch of pre-fab stuff. But, it also comes with some handy, commonly-used features and tooling so you needn't waste time building them from scratch.

Checkout the [sinag docs](https://sinag.thinkaquamarine.com/) to get started. Happy coding!

>ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** *To open the docs up locally, run `npm install && npm run docs` within the theme's directory.*
